       <h1>Climb Sigiriya</h1>
       <br>
      <br>
      <br>
        <p>One of Sri Lanka's seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites, this rock-top fortress dates back to the 
        fifth century AD. The atmosphere is more spiritual than militant: in its time, 
        it has acted as a royal palace and a Buddhist monastery.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Sigiriya is also regarded as one of the most important urban planning projects of the first millennium,
        and is home to some of the oldest landscaped gardens in the world. Look out too for the mirror wall,
        a masonry wall that was so well-polished that the king 
         could see his reflection in it. Top tip: go early, so avoiding the heat of the day and the crowds. </p>

        <h1>Get up close to wild elephants in a National Park</h1>
        <br>
       <br>
         <p>You will see elephants everywhere you go in Sri Lanka: working on a tea plantation, running wild in national parks,
              and leading the Esala Perahera parade in Kandy in all their bejewelled and sequined glory.
<br>
            Udawalawe National Park offers you one of your best chances of seeing elephants roaming free.
             Created to protect the watershed of the enormous Udawalawe Reservoir, this park is home to around
              400 pachyderms and has extensive stretches of grassland as well as scrub jungle and riverine forest. 
              It is one of the best places to go birdwatching in Sri Lanka too.
            <br><br>
            Gal Oya National Park receives fewer visitors than many of the other parks and also offers a unique experience. 
            Here, the elephants commonly swim across Senanayake Samudra lake - Sri Lanka's largest body of water - and
             you can take a boat safari to see them.
            <br><br>
            And to see the world's largest congregation of Asian elephants visit Kadulla or Minneriya NP in the 
            dry season (June/July to September) when what is known as "the Gathering" takes place as 
            hundreds of the pachyderms cluster around water.</p>

        <h1>Relax on the beaches of Arugam Bay</h1>
        <br>
       <br>
         <p> The beach at Arugam Bay, on Sri Lanka's dry south-east coast, is the stuff of Bounty ads are made of: sugar-soft sands, 
             coconut palms and utter solitude but for the whoops and whooshes of the surfers riding the point.

            Before the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, the bay was rapidly becoming one of the world’s top surf destinations. 
            For the time being, you’ll have the double curve of beach and its coconut palm-covered point more or less to 
            yourself, bar a few savvy sun-seekers.</p>

        <h1>Take time to explore the city of Kandy</h1>
        <br>
       <br>
         <p>The last capital of the ancient kings of Sri Lanka, and a popular getaway for colonial administrators looking to
              escape the heat, Kandy is a pretty
              place – tucked beside a lake in the country’s central highlands.

            Make sure you visit the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which is housed in Kandy's teeming temple complex. 
            Wars have been fought over this relic, believed to have belonged to Buddha himself. Join the devout to add 
            your own petal offerings and light votive candles.
            
            If your visit coincides with the spectacular Esala Perahera Festival - a late-June, early-July celebration
            paying homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic - make sure you get a good seat. The lively parade means that restaurants
             and shops along the route sell tickets, so book your spot early. </p>

        <h1>Succumb to Galle’s Colonial charms</h1>
        <br>
       <br>
         <p> Built by the Dutch in 1663, the walled city of Galle, on the country's southernmost top and 
             surrounded by ocean on three sides, is a must on any visit to Sri Lanka.

            Inside the fort, you’ll find Dutch Colonial buildings, ancient mosques and churches,
             museums and lots of quirky boutique cafés and restaurants. Outside, you'll be laying
              your eyes on some of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka.
            
            Don’t forget to drop by nearby Koggala to see the famous stilt fisherman.
            Spotting them perched in the ocean on their frames - made from sticks and twine - is 
            one of the most iconic and extraordinary sights in the country.</p>

       <br>
         <p> Long off the tourist trail, the city of Jaffna, in Sri Lanka’s formerly troubled Tamil north, is finally coming into its own.

            Its ancient fort is a delight to explore and far less crowded than Galle. Nallur Kandaswamy Hindu temple is a hive of devout worshippers and the markets are colourful, lively and the perfect introduction to local life in the north.
            
            Uncrowded beaches and islands are but a short hop away, too, as is Keerimalai Hot Springs, a popular bathing spot for curing all that ails you.

       <br>
         <p>Sri Lankan food is not dissimilar to that served in India to the north. But with the sea never far away, the emphasis is on 
             seafood, always fresh and delicious, caught that very day.

            Jaffna Crab Curry is regarded as the best in the world, especially when sampled at the source where chefs take their time 
            to grind the coconut, making the paste toasty and rich. 
            In the south, seek out Squid Curry, cooked quickly in coconut cream and lime juice. </p>

        <h1>Have a close encounter with whales</h1>
        <br>
       <br>
         <p>Sri Lanka’s southern tip nudges the depths of the continental shelf. It’s an area favoured by blue whales and nowhere else does the world’s biggest creature swim so close to land, so reliably.

            Dondra Head is your jumping off point. From January to April, blue whales pass here on their route from the 
            Bay of Bengal to the western Indian Ocean. They fill their bellies on the krill and squid that thrive in these waters,
             enriched by the outfall of Sri Lanka’s 103 rivers. </p>

         <p>Taking a upcountry rail journey is one of the best ways to see the natural beauty of Sri Lanka’s 
             hill country and large number of travellers take it every day. The train cut through the lush green 
             vegetation inch by inch on a spiral-shaped railway track. It passes steep ravines, patches of forests,
              cascading waterfalls, perineal waterways, gloomy tunnels, vegetable plots and tea gardens on its arduous
               march to the heart of Sri Lanka’s hill country.
